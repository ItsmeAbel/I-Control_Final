    <string name="Our_info">We are four friends that go to high school and we decided to try and help people with drinking issues. Our goal is to use programming and a device that almost everybody has now days (a phone), to understand if someone is drunk. If so our application is set to assist them so they dont make decisions they might regret later on.</string>
    <string name="Acc_text">Hold your phone and start walking as streight as you can. Shaking the phone too much will result in a failure. The step counter will detect and tell you how many steps you have taken but remember that it has a slight delay so you will not see the counter increase right away. Good Luck !!!</string>
    <string name="walk_streight">Keep walking streight until you clear the test!! Keep your balance</string>
